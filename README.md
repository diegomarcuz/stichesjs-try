# Watch Me

## I decided to take a look how [Stiches](https://stitches.dev/), CSS-in-JS library, works. 

#### Very handy library, I appreciate so much write CSS directly in the component. Each component SideBar (List of genres), Button (each genre item), Content (List of movies), MovieCard (each movie card) has your own styles written in your file.

## Kick off

1. JSON Server (responsible to store the genres and movies)
    - `yarn server` or `npm run server`
  
2. React
    - `yarn dev` or `npm run dev`

## Technologies 

- ReactJS using Context API (share state between components)
- StichesJS (CSS-in-JS library)
